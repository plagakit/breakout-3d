I have a week to make Breakout and put a cool lil spin on it, so this is a plan
to budget my time effectively. I can spend around 1-2 hours everyday working on
the project, so I should budget my time with that in mind.

Game Idea:
- Breakout but it's a roguelike
  - Will demonstrate basic abilities to code things like breakout 
    but also how to architect larger complex systems that are in things
    like a roguelike
- Gameplay loop: when you destroy the grid of bricks, you advance to a 
  harder grid of bricks and player powers up
  - How to scale difficulty?
    - Different brick types that make it harder to hit ball
    - More bricks
  - How to power up player?
    - Offer 3 upgrades for the player to choose
    - "Inventory system" for upgrades
- Making it more fun
  - I played a lot of Bushido Ball, a game in UFO 50, which is like
    Pong but really fun because it has a unique movement style
  - Implementing characters like bushido ball could be unique and fun spin
    on breakout and would also include making systems like animation and
    state machines(?)

Monday
- Goals: make plan, think of ideas, create project
- Achieved: done all of above, made simple Raylib app

Tuesday
- Goals: implement basic breakout w/ ECS
- Achieved: 
  - Refactored entity view to be able to use parallel execution policy
  - Made ball movement, I can update ~1 million balls at 60 FPS w/ parallel execution
  - I'll push basic breakout to tomorrow, and bushido character to thursday while planning
    architecture throughout

Wednesday
- Goals: make bushido ball-style character
- Achieved: 
  - Made 2D collisions, simple breakout

OK this is where the plan has diverged. I've made a simple 2D breakout, but I wanna
be ambitious. Larian makes 3D games, I'm sure they'd be looking for a 3D skillset.

Thursday
- Goals: catch up for previous days, plan architecture for overall game
- Achieved: 

Friday
- Goals: turn into roguelike
- Achieved: 

Saturday
- Goals: turn into roguelike pt. 2
- Achieved: 

Sunday
- Goals: turn into roguelike pt. 3
- Achieved: 

Monday
- Goals: code cleanup, testing, etc.
- Achieved:
